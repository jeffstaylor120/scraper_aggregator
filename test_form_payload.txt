Q1 2024
The strong market momentum from 2023 spilled over into the first quarter of this year, as global equity markets marched higher on much better-than-feared economic data, an improving corporate earnings picture, and a continuation of the AI mania that dominated last year's market narrative. The MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) of global stocks gained 8.2% for the quarter to finish at a new high-water mark, representing its 21st new record high so far this year.
• The S&P 500 Index logged a 10.6% total return during the first quarter, capping a five-month win streak during which blue chip U.S. stocks advanced 30% off of late October lows and added more than $9 trillion in market value. The index reached a new record high on January 24th, fully erasing the bear market losses from 2022, and the S&P notched 21 more records before quarter end.
Q2 2024
Fueled by a moderating of global inflationary pressure, growing optimism around an easing of financial conditions by central bankers that seems increasingly imminent, and a continuation of the AI-mania that has gripped investors for more than a year, global equity markets continued their hot streak through the second quarter. The MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) of global stocks gained 2.9% in Q2, capping an 11.3% total return for the global blue-chip benchmark through mid-year and a near 50% rally since stocks bottomed in late September of 2022.
• The S&P 500 Index logged a 4.3% total return during the second quarter, boosting year-to- date gains to 15.3% and continuing a three-quarter win streak that has added more than $10 trillion in market value. Through Q2, the S&P notched 31 new records highs so far this year.
Q3 2024
Global equity markets enjoyed a strong, broad-based rally during the third quarter, as stronger corporate earnings, better-than-expected economic data, and the official launch of the Federal Reserve's long-awaited rate cutting cycle fueled demand for risk assets. The MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) of global stocks gained 6.6% in Q3, bringing year-to-date returns to 18.7%.
• The S&P 500 Index logged a 5.9% total return during the third quarter to boost YTD gains to 22.1%, continuing a four-quarter win streak and capping the best YTD September return for the blue-chip index since 1997. The S&P closed the quarter at a new all-time high, its 43rd record close so far this year.
Q4 2024
Despite a late December sell off, global equity markets gave investors a lot to cheer in 2024, posting a second consecutive year of strong, double-digit returns. The MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) of global stocks retreated 1.0% in Q4, but the index still posted a full-year total return of 17.5% to extend the current bull market past the two-year mark.
• The S&P 500 Index logged a 2.4% total return during the fourth quarter to boost full-year gains to 25.0%, continuing a five-quarter win streak and capping the best two-year return (57.9%) for the blue-chip index since 1997-98.
• The S&P hit 57 new record highs and added $10 trillion in market value in 2024.
Q1 2025
The first quarter was a tale of two halves for the global equity markets.  Building on the strong momentum of the prior two years, the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) surged nearly 6% and hit multiple record highs during the first six weeks of 2025, but a steady selloff in risk assets erased those gains and more by quarter's end.    When the dust settled, global stocks suffered a modest 1.3% loss for the quarter, but this reversal set the stage for the much sharper correction in stocks we have experienced in early April following the announcement of the Trump administration's aggressive global tariff program.
• After a fast start culminating in the Index's third new record high of the year on February 19th, the S&P 500 Index corrected more than 10% by mid March to record a first quarter loss of 4.3%, snapping a five-quarter win streak for U.S. blue chip stocks.
Q2 2025
Following the announcement of Trump's harsher-than-expected tariff policy, global stocks suffered one of their worst three day drops in history before fully recovering to reach new record highs by quarter's end. After dropping more than 10% during this stretch to flirt with bear market territory, the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) rebounded to post second quarter and year-to-date returns of 11.5% and 10.1%, respectively, to close the first half at its seventeenth new record high so far this year.
• U.S. stocks followed a similar pattern, as the S&P 500 declined 18.9% between its record high on February 19th and its early April lows, only to finish the second quarter at new record highs. Q2 and YTD returns for the blue-chip index were 10.9% and 6.2%, respectively.
• Just five stocks drove 55% of the S&P's Q2 return, led by strong gains in mega caps NVIDIA (+46%), Microsoft (+33%), Broadcom (+65%), Meta (+28%), and Amazon (+15%).
